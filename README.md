# SimpleChattyBot
Here, at the beginning of your programmerâ€™s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own.
This project is a part of the [Kotlin Basics](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18) track on JetBrains Academy.

## Learning Outcomes
Get to know the basic syntax of Kotlin and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.
